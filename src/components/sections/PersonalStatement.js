              <p>Hi and welcome to my honors portfolio! This website holds the entries and reflections for many of the experiences and classes I have had during my time at the University of Washington. If you look below, you will see that at the start of my time here, I took a lot of random classes- everything from chemistry to western religions. At the time, I wanted to explore a lot of different subject areas and I was searching for potential majors. However, if you look at more recent portfolio entries, you will see that my focus narrowed as I discovered what I wanted to study - philosophy and informatics! </p>

              <p>My entries also include many non-academic experiences, including work experiences, camping trips, and travel experiences. Many of my most memorable and impactful experiences during my time at UW have been outside of the classroom. During this time, I have had the opportunity to work as a barista in a cafe on Mt. Rainier and as an swim instructor for toddlers. I have had the opportunity to study abroad, backpack through the Olympic Mountains, and participate in a 90-mile relay race. </p>

              <p>These experiences have taught me what it means to succeed in the university setting, but also what it means to fail. Itâ€™s been a long road but I am thankful for the opportunities that I have had during my time as an undergrad and I cannot wait to see what the next leg in life has in store! </p>
