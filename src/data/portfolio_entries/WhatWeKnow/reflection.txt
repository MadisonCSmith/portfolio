This was one of the first essays that I wrote in college and I remember feeling out of my depth as I wrote it. I did not feel like I was prepared to write historical analysis' or knew enough to analyze historical depictions. I ended up making claims that I could not support well nor made much sense. I struggled with this paper, and I remember recognizing  the importance of making small supportable claims rather than large unsupportable ones. This class also taught me a lot about the a variety of humanities, including philosophy, geography, and history. It's where I first really learned about philosophy and why I ended up taking a philosophy intro class.
