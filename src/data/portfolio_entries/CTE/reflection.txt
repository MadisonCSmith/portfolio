During my years at Classroom Technology and Events, I learned a lot about management and leadership. I was given a lot of responsibility regarding the training new student employees and management of the evening preventative management shifts. I learned a lot about how to keeping people on the same page. I was surprised as the difficulty of management and I gained some appreciation for managers and the balancing of the needs of the organization and the needs of employees and adapting when plans don't go to plan. 
As a result of my time here, I discovered that I enjoyed for organizing and keeping things together. I enjoy having a variety of things to do. I also learned a lot about A/V hardware and web development. This furthered my own interest in technology outside the classroom. Another skill I developed during this time was public speaking. I was responsible for leading a daily meeting and training new employees. Over time I learned how to speak concisely and effectively with little preparation in front of a dozen employees. I have realize that my speaking skills that I have developed here have helped me in classes when I have had to do presentations. Through this job, I also gained confidence in leading and problem-solving under pressure. There were times in this job there I had to identify and fix a problem with A/V hardware in front a of a lecture hall of students. I have had to learn how to take charge of situation where I am not confident, and I do not initially know the answer. As a result of my time at CTE, I have been able to develop essential life and professional skills including leadership, management, speaking skills and problem-solving. I have developed my own interests in management and organizing, and confirmed my own interest in technology.
