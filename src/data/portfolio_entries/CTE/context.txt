This was a job that I had during the majority of my time at UW. I began as a Evening Maintenance Assistant, where I was tasked with checking class room technology like projectors, control systems, and monitoring and basic troubleshooting. After nearly a year I was promoted to the Lead Student Supervisor where I was tasked with supervising the shift of students who were tasked with checking and troubleshooting technology. I was also tasked with more advanced troubleshooting skills. In my final year in this job, I stepped back and focused on our website worked mostly with web development.
