This assignment went smoothly enough at first, I picked some classes that were required in my major, minor, and some honor classes. The trick was trying to fit all these classes into four years. After playing with my schedule for a bit, I got the classes where I wanted them. Then I ran an audit. A rather lengthy list of unfulfilled requirements popped up. I needed a diversity class? What was a diversity class? After spending more time fiddling with my schedule, I eventually managed to make a schedule that fulfilled all the requirements. I knew going into college that it was hard to graduate in four years. However, it was not until I tried completing all the credits I needed to graduate into four years, that I realized how hard it is. People tell you that you have time to decide on your major. They tell you that there is time to take some general interest classes. But after completing this assignment, I realized that this is only partially true. Sure, I have a year or two before I have to know what my major is, but during that year or two, I have to complete the requirements I need to get into my major. I have to be deliberately taking classes that fulfill general requirements needed to graduate. I have time to take classes I want, but I have to ensure that at the same time, they are fulfilling requirements. This assignment only shows how much every class matters.
