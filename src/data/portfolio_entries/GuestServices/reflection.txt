I learned a lot about community and the characteristics of a strong community during my time on that mountain. There were about sixty other employees that lived up at Paradise that summer and from my first day there was a sense of community that I have found in very few other places. This was in part due to the location, the size of the population, and the limited access to the outside friends, family, and information. Sixty people stranded on a mountain with little access to cell phones, internet, or entertainment will bond surprisingly quickly. But I also think this sense of community was formed in part due to shared struggles. Living in such a confined environment, everyone was forced to go through many of the same struggles. When the water got shut off and we had to struggle through several hours of serving guests with no water, this impacted everyone at Paradise from the kitchen staff who had to cook and clean with no water, to the front desk employees who had to communicate with unhappy guests, to the cafe staff who had to run a cafe without most of their drinks. At the end of the day, we all had experienced the same struggle and frustration and this gave us something to talk about and share. In larger environments, such unique experiences and struggles are rarely experienced universally across the population and people are unable to bond in the same way. There is power in shared struggles and a smaller environment in building community. Going forward, I am more aware of struggles' impact on a community and how common experiences can have a powerful impact on a group of people.
