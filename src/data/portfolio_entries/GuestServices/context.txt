This was a summer job I had at Paradise Inn in Mt. Rainier National Park. Paradise is a somewhat remote popular tourist area on Mt. Rainier. I primarily worked as a barista in the inn. During this time, I lived in an employee dorm that was located essentially at the trailhead of many of trails at Paradise so I easy access hiking and camping and spent a lot of in my free time exploring the park.
