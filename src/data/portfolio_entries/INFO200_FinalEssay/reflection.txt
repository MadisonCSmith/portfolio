This class was a major reason why I decided to apply to the informatics major. I really admired how this class, and informatics in general, was self-aware and made efforts to see beyond the technical components of applications. This project gave us the opportunity to think through various problems, potential solutions, and their impact. Perhaps it's the philosophy part of me, but I enjoyed exploring not only the applications themselves, but also how they interacted with the world.
