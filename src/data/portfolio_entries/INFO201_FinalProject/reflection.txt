The course for this final project was an introductory course for the informatics program and it gave me a lot of foundational technical skills that I had been weak on for a while. I am grateful that I took the class as early as I did, but I also wish that I had taken it earlier. I found that many of the skills I had learned in upper level informatics courses that I took before this course were rooted in shaky foundations because I had waited so long to take this course. After taking this course, I have found myself going back through some of the content from my previous courses and to solidify some of these shaky foundations. I guess this goes to show that the especially in more technical skills, the foundational knowledge base is important to get right the first time.
