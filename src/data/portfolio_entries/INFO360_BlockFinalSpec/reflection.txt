Throughout this project I learned a lot about design and what it meant to design something. Before this class, and particularly this project, I thought of design as a sort of superficial. I thought design was about the color and the font-size. Design was the pretty packaging of a product or application. However, this class and particularly this project changed my view around this. I realized that design goes a lot deeper than I previously thought. While I initially didn't particularly appreciate design, I found that after taking class that the aspect of design appealing to me. I felt that design was far more interesting and complicated than I initially thought. In the end, being more aware of design-thinking in my projects. I also learned that technology cannot always provide the best or complete solution. As students who study technology, I think it's easy to see all amazing things that technology and assume that technology can and probably should provide solutions to everything. But I think as students of technology it's important to recognize the limitations of technology. In this project, we tried to solve procrastination in students with an application. Honestly, procrastination is a symptom of a larger problem and while we can try to control the symptoms, I think it would have been more effective to solve the larger problem.
