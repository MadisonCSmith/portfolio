This was a sort of class that that I was involved with through the Education department. This class was part mentoring and part class. The class was focused on supporting students who had signed up for extra support. The support was mostly focused on the study skills and giving the information that they needed to thrive in the university setting, rather than specific help with certain subjects. I tutor-mentored two students and met with each of them twice a week for two hours during this quarter.
