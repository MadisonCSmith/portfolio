Despite the briefness of this assignment, I found it particularly helpful. This sheet took away some of the anxiety I faced when I was first faced with the question of what I wanted to do with my time here and allowed me to make some doable, short-term goals, rather than focus on overwhelming, long-term goals, like picking a major. However, at the same time, the number of opportunities we have here at UW is so wide, that choosing a couple goals becomes a task in itself.
