A powerful part of science fiction is its ability to create universes where the social hierarchies that we have become accustomed to are overturned. In consuming these pieces of writing and film, I found it difficult to wrap my head around these world where I had to not only learn the languages, locations, and characters of this new world, but I also had to learn the more implicit parts of society like social hierarchies. There were worlds where women were the gender with more power, or where gender looks completely different that how it does in our society. In order to understand the plotlines of many of the stories we were reading and watching in this class, I was forced to abandon many of the implicit assumptions I had walked into the class with. Through this I spent a lot of time exploring how social hierarchies could change and how the characteristics of humans that these social hierarchies are rooted in, like gender and race, can be conceived of completely differently than in our society.
