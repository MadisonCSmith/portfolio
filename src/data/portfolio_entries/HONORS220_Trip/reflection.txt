This was a unique class for many reasons, but one of the most obvious reasons is that this class didn't take place in a classroom. There weren't any true lectures or assignments during this nine day period. Rather, the class happened organically out in a national park. One thing I found interesting about this class was comparing how much I felt like I learned outside of the classroom setting versus in the typical classroom setting. I found that outside of the classroom setting, I felt like I wasn't absorbing information at the same rate as I did in the classroom. One possible reason why I felt like this is possibly because the learning was spread out over the course of a day rather in one or two hour lectures. So it's entirely possible that I retained a larger rate of the information given to us, but it didn't feel like I had because the information wasn't fed to us at the same pace and so I wasn't absorbing information at the pace as in a lecture. Another possibility is that after spreading years in classrooms, that something about a classroom triggers something that signals that it's time to focus and absorb information. I noticed that out in nature that I didn't dial in and focus in the same that I would in the classroom. But perhaps more importantly, while I may or may not have retained the same amount of information outside of the classroom, it never really felt like a class in same way a class in a classroom felt. By that I mean, that this class was fun. I wanted to be there. There were hard parts, sure, but overall, it didn't feel like a chore like attending class often feels like a chore.
