This was a class that I took through the interdisciplinary honors program. The class primarily consisted of a nine day backpacking trip through Olympic National Park during summer quarter. For nine days we hiked around fifty miles from Deer Park to Hurricane Ridge. The class focused on landscapes in the Olympic National Park and the role of nature in our society.
