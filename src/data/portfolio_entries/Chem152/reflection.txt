I have always been a big believer in hard work. I struggled with this lab report, and in the intro to chemistry series in general, but I believed that if I worked hard enough, I would not only learn the material, but I would also learn to like chemistry. A couple quarters in the chemistry series, and not only was I still struggling with the class, but I didn't like chemistry anymore than when I started. I ended up reevaluating why I was taking the class and I didn't have a good reason beyond that chemistry seemed like a good strong class. I was struggling over something that I wasn't really benefiting from. I eventually ended up dropping the class. What I took away from this experience is that while hard work is essential, it can't make up for a lack of interest in the subject. I learned that there's a lot of value in pursuing things that I truly have an interest in, rather than things I want to have an interest in.
