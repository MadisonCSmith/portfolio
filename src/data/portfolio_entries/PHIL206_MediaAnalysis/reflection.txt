I think that this class, and especially this essay, helped me view the world more critically. We are taught to critically read essays and other literature, but I think it is easy to absorb a lot of other content, especially content like music videos without a lot of critical thought. After watching the video who knows how many times while writing this essay, it became apparent that at least some of the content that we absorb much of the time mindlessly absorbing contained a lot of valuable and important messages. I also noticed while taking this class that I become much more aware of the injustices and discrimination prevalent in my daily life after taking this course. Before this class, I think a lot of micro aggressions slipped past me.
