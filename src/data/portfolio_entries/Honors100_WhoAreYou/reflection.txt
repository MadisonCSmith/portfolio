As first this assignment felt like a longer version of the same conversation I have had with teachers, grandparents, and friends for the past few months. I am going to UW. This is why. It was not until I got to the part where I had to explain what I wanted to do with my time here at UW that I got stuck. What did I want to do with my time here? I got to college- that was the goal, wasn't it? What was I going to do with my time here? So, I wrote down a few things about study abroad and Peace Corps, and turned the assignment in. But really, I did not know what I was going to with my time here. It seemed as though my opportunities had suddenly opened up. All the possible paths that I could potentially take were all overwhelming. Ultimately, it was this assignment that initially got me to consider all the paths I could take.
