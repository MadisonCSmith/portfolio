This paper was significant for me because it changed how I approached papers. Prior to this paper, I usually sketched out a quick ten minute outline and then jumped right into writing the paper. However, for this paper I took a lot more time on my outline. This time allowed me to develop and integrate on my ideas. Once my ideas were more developed, then I began to write. The development of my ideas ultimately led to increases the level of my papers and ultimately makes writing papers easier. As a result, I think I have gotten a lot more out of writing my papers and better understand the material as a result.
