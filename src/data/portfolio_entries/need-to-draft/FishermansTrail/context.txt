Fisherman's Trail In Donnellan’s claim about the definite descriptions, he seems to argue that there is some meaning behind language behind the literal meaning of language and that meaning is the actual meaning of language. I would argue that that is an interpretation of a piece of language, rather than the actual meaning of language, because it’s possible for language to be interpreted differently, in which case the same piece of language would have different meanings in the same context, which doesn’t make sense.
