This is a portfolio of everything I completed in my INFO 362 class, Visual Information Design. The class focused entirely learning design principles, integrating over designs, and getting peer critiques on our designs for our final product, an infographic. My final infographic in on the homepage of my portfolio. I loved this class and would happily take it again. This class had a huge impact on my career interests.
