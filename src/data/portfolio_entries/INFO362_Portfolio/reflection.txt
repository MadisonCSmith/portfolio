I loved this class. It was through this class I discovered an interest in design. I discovered that design was one of those things I enjoyed and could spend hours doing and not feel like I'm doing "work". I enjoyed the interactive portion of design and the visual nature of design. Another thing I liked about this class was the structure. This class almost entirely consisted of completing a small portion of our overall infographic and then getting feedback on it and then iterating over this design a few times before settling on a final design. I enjoyed the "doing" emphasis of this class. I feel like most classes focus on the listening part of learning, but this class was different and I found that I really enjoyed it and learned a lot more than I probably would have the class had been more lecture-based. As a result, I discovered more about my learning style. I have always known that I am a visual learner, but after this class I really came to understand that I learn a lot by doing as well, and furthermore, doing is a lot more engaging than lectures.
