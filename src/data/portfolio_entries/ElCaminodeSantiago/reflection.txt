There were many key things that I learned from this trail. The first, I suppose, is the power of breaking big things apart and consistently tackling those bits one at a time. On the trail, we walked over 300 kms. And we did that, not by doing as much as we could everyday, But we did as much as we could while still being able to get up the next morning. Sometimes this meant putting forward only 80% a day. After finishing this trail and looking back on the distance I had walked, I realized that there is a difference between giving one hundred percent in a day and one hundred percent over time. It's not hard to give 100% in a day- but it takes strategy to put forward 100% over time. Ultimately this changed the way I thought about my schoolwork. For a long time I was that procrastinating student that did panic marathons of essay writing/exam studying/debugging the night before the thing was due. I found that after this trail, I could better appreciate the slow putting together of assignments and essays rather than the last minute procrastination. Although working on something only to put it down only partly completed after an hour or two for several nights in a row feels less productive than an eight hour marathon the night before a thing was due, ultimately it is the better strategy. When I approach my schoolwork this way the quality of my assignments is better and I don't feel exhausted like I am giving 100% everyday.
