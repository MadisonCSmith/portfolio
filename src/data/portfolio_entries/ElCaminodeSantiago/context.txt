Over the summer, I spent three weeks walking El Camino de Santiago Compostela. El Camino is a historical pilgrimage, that has regained popularity in recent years. The trail ends in Santiago de Compostela, a town in north western Spain where St. James is supposedly buried. There are many different routes to Santiago, but we took the Camino Frances, a route through northern Spain. During my time on the trail, I walked over 300 kms, from Leon, through Santiago, and then continued on to Fisterra, on the coast. During this time I stayed in hostels in anywhere from large cities Leon to small villages.
