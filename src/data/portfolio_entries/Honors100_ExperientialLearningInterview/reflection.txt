One of the biggest benefits I found in this project was the time I spent looking into specific study abroad opportunities for Emily. The time I spent looking into study abroad for her allowed me to discover some opportunities that I would be interested in. I learned that it was possible to fulfill some Honors credits as well additional requirements through a study abroad. In a large part due to this assignment, I am considering taking part in a summer study abroad during my time here.
