This is an assignment I completed for my intro to interdisciplinary honors class. This assignment involved an interview with a peer to discover their interests. Then we were suppose to explain three learning projects that fit their interests and the honors program for experiential learning. My partner was Emily and I recommended that she join a mathematics research team, study abroad, or join the Dream Project for her two experiential learning projects.
