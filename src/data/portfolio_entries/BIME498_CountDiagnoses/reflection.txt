One of the things that I learned through this assignment, it the difficulty of parsing free text, yet, we learned in class that there is usefulness of free text- (more efficient, include relevant details, what doctors are used to etc. It would be possible to create Electronic Medical records that are perfectly computer-parsable. These records could make research around medicine much easier because computer can find patterns. But a perfectly computer-parsable electron medical record is not necessarily what is best for doctors and patients. There is some trade off between the benefits of creating an electronic medical record that is easily parsable and not parsable. This project is useful to my professional career because in the data science world is all about parsing data and there are a lot of data contained in free form text. The ability to  this data with some level of competency could open up a lot more data for analysis, and therefore open a lot more potential conclusion/results.It was also this project that made me realize how difficult relationship between technology and the medical world. In the medical world, change is taken slowly because any mistakes or even less than perfectly optimal technology can have catastrophic results in a person's life. However, the technology world approaches the world completely differently. Technology takes a fast-paced approach to the world. Companies will push working code and make it better later. Technology is all about innovating and changing things. This creates a tension between these two world, and I found that it's not necessarily a tension that I want to work in.
