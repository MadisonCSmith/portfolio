To Do:
 - write readme
 - change icon on web browser
 - fix mobile stuff
 - compress your images and scripts 
 - https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=http%3A%2F%2Frumpuspr.com%2F -- test page speed - make sure to optimize
 - animate arrow
 - separate out data processing and normal js stuff
 - Once you are finished doing development and want to deploy your code for your end users, you can use the optimizer to combine the JavaScript files together and minify it. In the example above, it can combine main.js and helper.js into one file and minify the result. (https://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html) (https://requirejs.org/docs/start.html)
 - add animation when delete filter - projects slide around gracefully


 Uses https://csv.js.org/ to convert csv file to json data and https://requirejs.org/docs/start.html to use require on client side app (require needed for csv.js).
