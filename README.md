 # Description

This is a portfolio I built to showcase some of my side projects. The portfolio was built using HTML, CSS, vanilla JS, and JQuery. 

I wanted to build a relatively quick project that allows me to showcase my projects, show a brief discussion of the project, a URL to the project, and allows the user to filter projects by skills and tools used in the projects.  

 # Status

The basic solvers for Sudoku and Minesweeper are built. I plan to streamline the solvers and new puzzles in the future.
